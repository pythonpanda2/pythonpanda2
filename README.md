- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm an Assistant Computational Scientist at the Data Science and Learning Division at the Argonne National Laboratory.

- :computer::thinking: I spend a lot of time thinking about problems at the interface of computational physics, chemical physics, and machine learning.

- üå± Previously, I was a postdoctoral appointee supervised by Dr. √Ålvaro V√°zquez Mayagoitia and Prof. Jacqueline Cole (University of Cambridge) at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility, Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), USA (2017-2020).
  -  During the postdoctoral years, I was working with leadership class super computers to deliver scientific solution for leading experimentalists in the domain of chemical physics.

- :mortar_board: I was awarded a Ph.D. in engineering physics from the Institute for Computational Physics, University of Stuttgart, Germany in 2017. During that period, I 
also served as guest researcher in √Öngstr√∂m Laboratory, Uppsala University, Sweden. 
  - I was researching electronic transport/ quantum information science of nanosensors: (1) quantum 
tunneling across functionalized gold electrodes for nextgen DNA sequencing (2) 2D materials for gas sensing and DNA sequencing.
