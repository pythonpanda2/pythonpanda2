- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm an **Assistant Computational Scientist** at the Data Science and Learning Division at the Argonne National Laboratory.

- :computer::thinking: I spend a lot of time thinking about problems at the interface of computational physics, chemical physics, and machine learning.

- üå± Previously, I was a postdoctoral appointee, supervised by **Dr. √Ålvaro V√°zquez Mayagoitia** and **Prof. Jacqueline Cole (University of Cambridge)** at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility, Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), USA (2017-2020).
  -  During the postdoctoral years, I was working with leadership class super computers to deliver scientific solution for leading experimentalists in the domain of chemical physics. During that time I worked on a number of  interdisciplinary projects: (1) [natural language process for literature mining optoelectronic molecules](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0306-0), (2) implemented [active learning](https://github.com/pythonpanda2/psik-workshop-AL-GAP) for [Gaussian Approximation Potential](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-020-00367-7), and [ML based molecular melting point predictions](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/ab8aa3/meta).

- :mortar_board: I was awarded a Ph.D. in engineering physics from the Institute for Computational Physics, University of Stuttgart, Germany in 2017. During that period, I 
also served as guest researcher in √Öngstr√∂m Laboratory, Uppsala University, Sweden. 
  - I was researching :computer: electronic transport/ quantum information science of nanosensors: (1) [quantum 
tunneling across functionalized gold electrodes for nextgen DNA sequencing](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2016/nr/c6nr00500d) (2) 2D materials for [gas sensing](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2019/ta/c9ta00674e/unauth) and [DNA sequencing](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2020/nr/d0nr04363j).
